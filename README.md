# Intrusion-Detection-System
Dataset : https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

With the non stop evolution of technologies, there creates a humungous quantity of data as a result.
Even though there is a massive open bright side for these technologies still dark side lurks around
every nook and corner. In order to monitor the network traffic and the massive data in a hand by
hand manner dynamically we need the help of intrusion detection system commonly abbreviated as
IDS. So the Firewall has been used as an malicious activity prevention mechanism in early stages of
networking and it has been found that the procedures used by them are not compatible with the new
threats and attacks that has been persistently rising along with the hike of every technological
refinement. Commercial intrusion detection system are widely available nowadays, IDS is a piece
of software that scans networks for unauthorized or malicious activity, it determines whether the
system is under attack . it accomplishes this by keeping track of network as well as the system
activity. So the IDS detects the intruders using two mechanism namely Signature based detection
and anomaly based detection, the key feature used on these detections are the signature and
behaviour. So the main objective of this project is to inculcate the machine learning algorithms in a
way to study and find out the patterns and then based on certain criteria classification method is
performed. Three machine learning models, namely Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree
Classifier and XGBoost were built to carry out the prediction
